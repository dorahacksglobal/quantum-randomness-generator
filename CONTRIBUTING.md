The project is supervised by Eric Zhang from Dora Factory. Bernard Liu investigated the DI-QRNG protocols following the papers in References section of README. In early stage of project, Si-Yu Chen tried experiments in AWS Braket and finished some codes, for example, the core.py which defines the CHSH game circuits. Bernard Liu completed other codes, including quantum tomography, 1E5 shots experiments, randomness comparison and extraction and NIST test. Bernard Liu wrote the README.
